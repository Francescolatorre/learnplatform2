# Repository Testing Strategy

## Overview

This directory contains tests for repository layer implementations. The testing strategy focuses on comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation testing to ensure data persistence operations work correctly.

## Testing Focus

### CRUD Operations

1. Create
   - Test creation of entities
   - Verify proper persistence
   - Validate transaction handling

2. Read
   - Test retrieval of single entities
   - Test collection queries
   - Verify related data loading

3. Update
   - Test entity modifications
   - Verify transaction isolation
   - Ensure data integrity

4. Delete
   - Test entity removal
   - Verify proper cleanup
   - Test not found scenarios

## Test Structure

- Each repository has its own test file (e.g., `test_assessment_repo.py`)
- Tests use pytest fixtures for setup and teardown
- Database transactions are properly isolated
- Factory Boy is used for test data generation

## Example Implementation

See `test_assessment_repo.py` for a reference implementation that demonstrates:

- Basic CRUD operation testing
- Proper use of fixtures
- Transaction handling
- Test data generation
- Error case handling

## Best Practices

1. Use descriptive test names that indicate the operation being tested
2. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
3. Keep tests focused on single operations
4. Properly clean up test data
5. Use appropriate assertions for data verification
