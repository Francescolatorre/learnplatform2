## Debugging Session on 2025-02-26

### Issue
The `DEBUG` setting in `backend/learningplatform/settings_test_temp.py` was set to `False`, which prevented detailed error messages during testing.

### Diagnosis
The initial diff failed because the content at the specified lines did not match the search content exactly. The `DEBUG` setting was correctly identified on line 64.

### Solution
The `DEBUG` setting was updated to `True` to enable detailed error messages during testing.

### Documentation Update
The `DEBUG` setting in `backend/learningplatform/settings_test_temp.py` was updated to `True` to enable detailed error messages during testing.
