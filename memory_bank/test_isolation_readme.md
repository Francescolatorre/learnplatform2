# Test Isolation Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide provides a comprehensive approach to implementing test isolation in the learning platform project. The goal is to properly categorize and isolate tests based on their requirements and characteristics, leading to a more maintainable and efficient test suite.

## Documentation Structure

### 1. Strategy (test_isolation_strategy.md)
- Overall approach to test isolation
- Test categories and their characteristics
- Implementation principles
- CI/CD considerations

### 2. Technical Implementation (test_settings_implementation.md)
- Detailed settings file configurations
- Database setup instructions
- Marker implementation
- Configuration changes

### 3. Migration Plan (test_migration_strategy.md)
- Step-by-step migration process
- Test classification guidelines
- Validation procedures
- Rollback procedures

### 4. Audit Template (test_audit_template.md)
- Current test inventory
- Classification status
- Migration progress tracking
- Validation status

### 5. Key Decisions (test_isolation_decisions.md)
- Technical decisions and rationale
- Trade-offs considered
- Implementation choices
- Future considerations

### 6. Implementation Tasks (test_isolation_tasks.md)
- Detailed task breakdown
- Timeline and dependencies
- Success criteria
- Risk mitigation

## How to Use These Documents

### For Project Managers
1. Start with test_isolation_decisions.md to understand the approach
2. Review test_isolation_tasks.md for planning
3. Use test_audit_template.md to track progress
4. Monitor implementation using the timeline

### For Developers
1. Begin with test_isolation_strategy.md for overview
2. Follow test_settings_implementation.md for technical setup
3. Use test_migration_strategy.md for updating tests
4. Reference test_audit_template.md for current status

### For DevOps
1. Focus on test_settings_implementation.md for configuration
2. Review test_isolation_strategy.md for CI/CD setup
3. Implement monitoring based on test_isolation_decisions.md
4. Follow timeline in test_isolation_tasks.md
