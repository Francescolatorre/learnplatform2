# Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-001: Course Versioning System Implementation

### 1. Title of the Decision
Implement a Course Versioning System for the Learning Platform

### 2. Context
The learning platform needs to support versioning of courses to track changes over time, allow instructors to experiment with course content without affecting the published version, and provide the ability to rollback to previous versions if needed. This is particularly important for maintaining course quality and ensuring that students have access to the most up-to-date and accurate content.

### 3. Decision
We will implement a comprehensive course versioning system with the following components:
- A `CourseVersion` model to store snapshots of course content at different points in time
- A `VersionControlService` to manage version control operations (create, compare, retrieve, rollback)
- Enhanced `Course` model with version-related fields
- API endpoints to expose version control functionality

### 4. Justification
This approach was chosen because:
- It provides a clean separation of concerns between the course model and version control logic
- It allows for efficient storage of version history by only storing the differences between versions
- It provides a flexible API for version control operations
- It integrates well with the existing course management system

Alternatives considered:
1. **Event Sourcing**: Storing all changes as events and reconstructing the course state from these events. Rejected due to complexity and performance concerns.
2. **Complete Course Duplication**: Creating a new course record for each version. Rejected due to data duplication and relationship management complexity.
3. **External Version Control System**: Using an external system like Git. Rejected due to integration complexity and overhead.

### 5. Consequences

#### Positive
- Instructors can experiment with course content without affecting the published version
- Course history is preserved for audit and quality control purposes
- Ability to rollback to previous versions if issues are discovered
- Better tracking of course evolution over time

#### Negative
- Increased database storage requirements for version history
- Additional complexity in the course management system
- Potential performance impact when retrieving version history for courses with many versions
- Need for careful handling of relationships between course versions and related entities (tasks, enrollments, etc.)

## ADR-002: Governance Model and Mode Definitions

### 1. Title of the Decision
Establish a Governance Model and Mode Definitions for the Learning Platform Project

### 2. Context
As the Learning Platform project grows in complexity, there is a need for a structured approach to task management, mode interactions, and documentation. The current ad-hoc approach lacks clarity on responsibilities, workflows, and communication standards. This leads to inconsistencies in task execution, documentation, and code quality.

### 3. Decision
We will establish a formal governance model and mode definitions that include:

1. **Governance Model**:
   - Mode Interaction Protocol
   - Task Management Process
   - Memory Bank Usage Guidelines
   - Communication Standards

2. **Mode Definitions**:
   - Architect Mode: Responsible for high-level system design and task planning
   - Code Mode: Responsible for implementation of tasks and requirements
   - Debug Mode: Responsible for systematic problem diagnosis and resolution
   - Ask Mode: Responsible for answering questions and providing information
   - Digital Design Mode: Responsible for requirements engineering and digital design

3. **Implementation**:
   - Create `memory_bank/governance_model.md` to document the governance model
   - Create `memory_bank/mode_definitions.md` to document mode definitions
   - Create `.roomodes` file in the workspace root directory to implement mode definitions

### 4. Justification
This approach was chosen because:
- It provides clear responsibilities for each mode
- It establishes a structured workflow for task management
- It ensures consistent documentation and communication
- It leverages the existing memory bank structure
- It allows for flexibility in mode switching based on task requirements

Alternatives considered:
1. **Single Mode Approach**: Using a single mode for all tasks. Rejected due to lack of specialization and clarity in responsibilities.
2. **Project Management Tool Integration**: Using external project management tools. Rejected due to integration complexity and overhead.
3. **Ad-hoc Approach**: Continuing with the current ad-hoc approach. Rejected due to inconsistencies and lack of structure.

### 5. Consequences

#### Positive
- Clear responsibilities and workflows
- Consistent documentation and communication
- Improved task management and tracking
- Better collaboration between different modes
- Enhanced project governance and quality control

#### Negative
- Initial overhead in setting up the governance model
- Learning curve for new team members
- Need for regular updates to the governance model as the project evolves
- Potential rigidity if the model is not flexible enough
