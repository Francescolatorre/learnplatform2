# Learning Platform System Architecture Patterns

## Overall Architecture
- Backend: Django REST Framework
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: JWT (Simple JWT)
- API Documentation: DRF Spectacular
- Testing: Pytest

## Backend Design Patterns

### Model Layer
- Custom User Model
  - Extends Django's AbstractUser
  - Adds role-based access control
- Generic Managers for Models
  - Custom create methods
  - Centralized business logic
- Explicit Relationship Definitions
  - ForeignKey with clear related_names
  - ManyToMany for flexible associations

### View Layer
- Class-based and Function-based Views
- Permission Classes
  - AllowAny for public endpoints
  - IsAuthenticated for protected routes
- Decorator-based Permissions

### Authentication Strategy
- JWT Token-based Authentication
- Refresh and Access Token Mechanism
- Stateless Authentication
- Role-based Access Control

### Testing Approach
- Pytest for Comprehensive Testing
- Isolated Test Databases
- Minimal External Dependencies
- Comprehensive Model and Endpoint Coverage

## Data Flow Patterns
1. User Registration
   - Validate Input
   - Create User
   - Generate JWT Tokens
   - Return User Profile

2. Course Creation
   - Validate User Permissions
   - Create Course
   - Associate Tasks
   - Return Course Details

3. Submission Workflow
   - Validate Submission
   - Store Submission
   - Update User Progress
   - Trigger Evaluation Process

## Performance Considerations
- Minimal Database Queries
- Efficient Model Relationships
- Lazy Loading of Related Objects
- Indexing for Frequent Queries

## Scalability Strategies
- Stateless Authentication
- Modular App Structure
- Dependency Injection
- Asynchronous Task Processing (Future)

## Security Patterns
- Input Validation
- JWT Token Rotation
- CORS Configuration
- Environment-based Configuration
- Minimal Exposure of Sensitive Data

## Future Architectural Improvements
- Microservices Potential
- Event-driven Architecture
- Advanced Caching Mechanisms
- Comprehensive Logging
- Monitoring and Observability
