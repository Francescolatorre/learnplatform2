## API Authentication Test Requirements (2025-04-11)

- The platform requires robust API authentication using JWT (Simple JWT, Django REST Framework).
- Playwright API/authentication tests must:
  - Target the backend at <http://localhost:8000>
  - Use valid test credentials (admin/adminpassword, instructor/instructor123, student/student123)
  - Obtain a JWT token via the login endpoint and use it for all protected API requests
- Test failures are most likely due to:
  - Backend not running or not accessible at the expected URL
  - Test users not present in the backend database
  - Authentication endpoints not fully implemented or not matching test expectations
  - JWT/token handling issues in the test code
- API implementation is IN_PROGRESS; test reliability depends on backend readiness and user data setup.

**Action:**

- Ensure backend is running and test users exist before running Playwright API/auth tests.
- Align test logic with backend authentication flow and update as backend implementation evolves.

## Technical North Star

Create an intelligent, adaptive learning platform that understands and nurtures individual learning potential through technology.
