# Architectural Decision Record: Backend Recreation with OpenAPI-Driven Development

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Learning Platform backend needs to implement a comprehensive API that follows a specific OpenAPI specification. The current backend implementation has basic models defined but lacks the complete API implementation required by the frontend. We need to decide whether to extend the current implementation incrementally or recreate the backend with a focus on the API specification.

## Decision
We will recreate the backend with an OpenAPI-driven development approach. This means:

1. Using the provided OpenAPI specification as the primary reference for API design
2. Extending the existing models to support all fields required by the API
3. Implementing Django REST Framework with JWT authentication
4. Using DRF Spectacular for OpenAPI schema generation and validation
5. Following a phased implementation approach (Authentication, Courses, Tasks, Quizzes)

## Rationale

### Why Recreate Rather Than Extend?
- The current backend implementation is in an early stage with only basic models defined
- A clean implementation based on the OpenAPI specification will ensure consistency
- Starting with a clear API contract will improve frontend-backend integration
- The OpenAPI specification provides a comprehensive blueprint for the entire API

### Why OpenAPI-Driven Development?
- Provides a clear contract between frontend and backend
- Enables automatic documentation generation
- Facilitates testing and validation
- Ensures consistency across all API endpoints
- Allows for schema-first development approach

### Why Django REST Framework with JWT?
- DRF is a mature, well-documented framework for building RESTful APIs
- JWT provides a stateless authentication mechanism suitable for modern web applications
- DRF's serializers provide robust validation and data transformation
- ViewSets and Routers simplify implementation of RESTful endpoints

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear API contract between frontend and backend
- Comprehensive documentation through OpenAPI schema
- Consistent implementation across all endpoints
- Improved developer experience with automatic schema generation
- Better testability with well-defined API contracts

### Negative
- Initial development overhead compared to ad-hoc API implementation
- Learning curve for developers not familiar with OpenAPI-driven development
- Potential rigidity if the API specification needs frequent changes

## Implementation Plan
The implementation will follow the plan outlined in the [API Implementation Plan](api_implementation_plan.md), with these key phases:

1. Project Setup and Model Extensions
2. Authentication API
3. Course API
4. Task API
5. Testing and Documentation
