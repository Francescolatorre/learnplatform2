# ADR: Task Selection Based on Complexity

## Context
The project involves multiple tasks with varying levels of complexity. To optimize workflow and resource allocation, tasks should be prioritized based on their complexity, starting with the least complex.

## Decision
The following tasks were identified as potentially less complex:
1. **Documentation Best Practices**: Involves documenting components, API usage, and adherence to best practices.
2. **Task Editing & Deletion**: Implementing a system for editing and deleting tasks.
3. **Design Task Management User Interface**: Designing a user interface for task management.
4. **Implement Frontend Task Creation Form**: Implementing a frontend form for task creation.
5. **Integrate Rich Text Editor for Task Descriptions**: Integrating a rich text editor for task descriptions.

The decision is to proceed with the "Documentation Best Practices" task as it typically involves less complexity and can be completed without extensive coding or architectural changes.

## Consequences
By prioritizing tasks based on complexity, the project can achieve quicker wins and maintain momentum. This approach also allows for better resource management and reduces the risk of bottlenecks.

## Status
Accepted
