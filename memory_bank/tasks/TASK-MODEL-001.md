# Task: Extend Database Schema for Learning Tasks

## Task Metadata
- **Task-ID:** TASK-MODEL-001
- **Status:** TODO
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Dependencies:** None

## Description
Design and implement a robust database schema for Learning Tasks with comprehensive field support and efficient querying.

## Requirements

### Database Schema Design
1. LearningTask Table Fields
   - `id`: Primary Key (UUID recommended)
   - `title`: String (max 255 characters)
   - `description`: Text field with markdown support
   - `course_id`: Foreign Key to Course model
   - `status`: Enum (Draft, Published, Archived)
   - `created_at`: Timestamp with timezone
   - `updated_at`: Timestamp with timezone
   - `created_by`: Foreign Key to User model
   - `max_submissions`: Integer (optional)
   - `deadline`: DateTime (optional)

2. Indexing Strategy
   - Create indexes on:
     - `course_id`
     - `status`
     - `created_at`
     - `updated_at`

### Technical Requirements
- Use Django ORM for model definition
- Implement custom model methods
- Support data validation
- Ensure database performance

## Validation Criteria
- [x] Schema follows Django ORM best practices
- [x] Tasks are properly stored in the database
- [x] Foreign key relationships are enforced
- [x] Indexing supports efficient queries

## Implementation Notes
- Use `django.db.models` for field definitions
- Implement custom validation methods
- Consider using `django-model-utils` for additional timestamp features

## Acceptance Criteria
1. LearningTask model is created with all specified fields
2. Database migrations work correctly
3. Model supports all required operations
4. Performance is optimized for querying

## Estimated Effort
- Database Schema Design: 3 story points
- Model Implementation: 2 story points
- Testing: 1 story point
- Total: 6 story points

## Potential Risks
- Complex indexing requirements
- Performance with large numbers of tasks
- Ensuring data integrity across relationships
