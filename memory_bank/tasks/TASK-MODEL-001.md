## Task Metadata
- **Task-ID:** TASK-MODEL-001
- **Status:** DONE
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Assigned To:** Code Mode
- **Completed At:** 2025-02-27 09:50:00

## Description
Design and implement a robust database schema for Learning Tasks with comprehensive field support and efficient querying.

## Requirements

### Database Schema Design
1. LearningTask Table Fields
   - `id`: Primary Key (UUID) ✓
   - `title`: String (max 255 characters) ✓
   - `description`: Text field with markdown support ✓
   - `course_id`: Foreign Key to Course model ✓
   - `status`: Enum (Draft, Published, Archived) ✓
   - `created_at`: Timestamp with timezone ✓
   - `updated_at`: Timestamp with timezone ✓
   - `created_by`: Foreign Key to User model ✓
   - `max_submissions`: Integer (optional) ✓
   - `deadline`: DateTime (optional) ✓

2. Indexing Strategy
   - Created indexes on:
     - `course_id`
     - `status`
     - `created_at`
     - `updated_at`

### Technical Requirements
- Used Django ORM for model definition ✓
- Implemented custom model methods ✓
- Supported data validation ✓
- Ensured database performance ✓

## Validation Criteria
- [x] Schema follows Django ORM best practices
- [x] Tasks are properly stored in the database
- [x] Foreign key relationships are enforced
- [x] Indexing supports efficient queries

## Implementation Notes
- Used `django.db.models` for field definitions
- Implemented custom validation methods
- Utilized `django-model-utils` for additional timestamp features

## Acceptance Criteria
1. LearningTask model created with all specified fields ✓
2. Database migrations completed successfully ✓
3. Model supports all required operations ✓
4. Performance is optimized for querying ✓

## Effort Breakdown
- Database Schema Design: 3 story points ✓
- Model Implementation: 2 story points ✓
- Testing: 1 story point ✓
- Total: 6 story points ✓

## Potential Risks Mitigated
- Complex indexing requirements addressed
- Performance considerations implemented
- Data integrity across relationships ensured

## Next Steps
- Proceed with TASK-MODEL-002: Implement database relationships
- Validate model with comprehensive test suite
