# Task: Repair Failing Tests for Task Models (TASK-TEST-REPAIR-001)

## Status
TODO

## Description
The unit tests for task models (`backend/tasks/tests/test_models.py`) are currently failing with import errors. This task is to investigate and repair these failing tests.

## Steps to Resolve
- **Investigate Import Errors**: Analyze the import errors in `backend/tasks/tests/test_models.py` and identify the root cause of the module resolution issues.
- **Fix Import Paths/Configurations**: Adjust import paths, `pytest.ini`, `conftest.py`, or VS Code settings as needed to resolve the import errors.
- **Run Tests and Verify**: Run the tests using `pytest backend` or `backend/run_tests.py` and ensure that all tests pass.
- **Document Findings**: Document the root cause of the import errors and the steps taken to resolve them in this task file.

## Dependencies
- TASK-MODEL-001 (Implementation of Task Models)

## Notes
- The tests were failing even after adding `AssessmentTask` and `QuizTask` models to `backend/tasks/models.py` and correcting import paths.
- The import errors might be related to project setup, Python path configuration, or VS Code Pylint settings.
- This task should be assigned to a developer with expertise in Django testing and Python environment configuration.

## Assigned To
- Code Mode or Debug Mode (depending on who will work on it)
