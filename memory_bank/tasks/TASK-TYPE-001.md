# Task Definition: Implement Text Submission Task Type

## Task ID
TASK-TYPE-001

## Task Description
Implement the text submission task type for the learning platform, allowing students to submit text-based responses to assignments.

## Requirements
1.  **Model Implementation**:
    *   Utilize the consolidated Task model with `task_type` set to 'TEXT_SUBMISSION'.
    *   Define specific attributes for text submission tasks:
        *   Maximum word count
        *   Minimum word count
        *   Formatting options (plain text, markdown, rich text)
2.  **Submission Handling**:
    *   Implement backend logic for text submission processing.
    *   Validate submissions against word count requirements.
    *   Store submission content securely.
3.  **Frontend Components**:
    *   Create text editor component for student submissions.
    *   Implement word count tracking and validation.
    *   Add formatting controls based on allowed formats.
4.  **Instructor Features**:
    *   Implement grading interface for text submissions.
    *   Add commenting and feedback functionality.
    *   Support for rubric-based assessment.
5.  **API Endpoints**:
    *   Create endpoints for text submission creation, retrieval, and update.
    *   Implement endpoints for submission and grading.

## Validation Criteria
*   Text submission tasks can be created by instructors.
*   Students can submit text responses within the defined constraints.
*   Submissions are properly validated and stored.
*   Instructors can grade and provide feedback on submissions.
*   All API endpoints function correctly.

## Resources
*   Consolidated Task model from TASK-MODEL-CONSOLIDATION-002
*   Existing submission handling code
*   Frontend component library

## Risks
*   Potential performance issues with large text submissions.
*   Security concerns with text content storage and rendering.
*   Compatibility issues with different browsers and devices.

## Mitigation Strategies
*   Implement size limits and pagination for large submissions.
*   Sanitize all user input to prevent XSS attacks.
*   Test across multiple browsers and devices.

## Communications
*   Coordinate with frontend team for UI implementation.
*   Document API endpoints for integration.
