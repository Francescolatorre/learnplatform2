# Task: Define Validation Rules for Learning Tasks

## Task Metadata
- **Task-ID:** TASK-VALIDATION-001
- **Status:** TODO
- **Priority:** High
- **Dependencies:** TASK-MODEL-001

## Description
Implement comprehensive validation rules for Learning Tasks to ensure data integrity, security, and proper workflow management.

## Requirements

### Validation Rules
1. Title Validation
   - Non-empty field
   - Maximum length of 255 characters
   - Trim whitespace
   - Prevent special character abuse

2. Description Validation
   - Allow markdown formatting
   - Implement sanitization to prevent script injection
   - Maximum length of 10,000 characters
   - Support basic HTML tags for formatting

3. Status Transition Rules
   - Enforce strict state machine for task status
     - Draft → Published (by course instructor)
     - Published → Archived (by course instructor or admin)
     - Archived → Draft (only by admin)
   - Log all status transitions
   - Prevent invalid state changes

4. Authorization Checks
   - Validate user permissions for task creation
   - Ensure only authorized instructors can modify tasks
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Track modification history

### Technical Requirements
- Use Django model validation
- Implement custom validation methods
- Create comprehensive permission checks
- Log validation events
- Support internationalization

## Validation Criteria
- [x] Invalid tasks are rejected
- [x] Status transitions follow predefined rules
- [x] Security checks prevent unauthorized modifications
- [x] Validation provides clear error messages

## Implementation Notes
- Use `clean()` method for model-level validation
- Implement custom validators
- Use Django signals for logging
- Create comprehensive test cases
- Consider using `django-guardian` for object-level permissions

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Task title and description are properly validated
2. Status transitions work as expected
3. Unauthorized modifications are blocked
4. Validation provides meaningful feedback

## Estimated Effort
- Validation Logic Design: 3 story points
- Implementation: 4 story points
- Security Hardening: 2 story points
- Total: 9 story points

## Potential Risks
- Complexity of status transition rules
- Performance overhead of extensive validation
- Ensuring consistent validation across different interfaces
