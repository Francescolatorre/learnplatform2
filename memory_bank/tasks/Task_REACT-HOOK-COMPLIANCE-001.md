# Task: REACT-HOOK-COMPLIANCE-001

**Status:** IN_PROGRESS

**Dependencies:** TYPESCRIPT-SERVICES-STANDARDIZATION-001

**Description:** Refactor all custom React hooks to ensure they exclusively use the standardized TypeScript service modules for data access, business logic, and side effects. This includes auditing all hooks, refactoring non-compliant ones, updating documentation, and potentially adding automated linting rules.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] All custom React hooks are audited for compliance.
- [ ] Non-compliant hooks are refactored to use standardized service modules.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect the new standard.
- [ ] Automated linting rules (if feasible) are added to prevent future non-compliance.

## Refactoring Steps

1. **progressService.ts:**
    - [ ] Add missing JSDoc/TSDoc to all public functions.
    - [ ] Review and test the updated service.
    - [ ] Note: TypeScript errors need to be addressed in a separate task.

2. **learningTaskService.ts:**
    - [ ] Add missing JSDoc/TSDoc to the class and all public methods.
    - [ ] Extract existing React hooks into a separate file (e.g., `learningTaskHooks.ts`).
    - [ ] Review and test the updated service and hooks.

3. **Documentation Update:**
    - [ ] Update relevant documentation to reflect the refactored hooks and their usage of service modules.

4. **Linting Rules (Optional):**
    - [ ] Investigate adding automated linting rules to enforce the use of service modules in React hooks.  This may require creating custom ESLint rules or using existing plugins.

5. **Testing:**
    - [ ] Run unit tests to ensure that the refactored hooks and services function correctly.  (Unit-Tests: npm run test:unit)
    - [ ] Conduct integration tests to verify that the changes do not introduce any regressions or unexpected behavior.(Integrationtests = npm run test:integration)

6. **Review:**
    - [ ] Conduct a thorough code review to ensure that the refactoring adheres to best practices and coding standards.

**Next Steps:** Perform the audit and refactoring, update documentation, and implement linting rules as needed.

**Completion Signal:** Use the `attempt_completion` tool to signal completion, providing a summary of the refactoring work and any challenges encountered.
