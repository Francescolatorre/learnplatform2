# Task: Implement Database Relationships for Learning Tasks

## Task Metadata
- **Task-ID:** TASK-MODEL-002
- **Status:** TODO
- **Priority:** Critical
- **Dependencies:** TASK-MODEL-001

## Description
Define and implement robust database relationships between Courses and Learning Tasks, ensuring data integrity and efficient querying.

## Requirements

### Relationship Design
1. Course to Learning Task Relationship
   - One-to-Many relationship
   - Course can have multiple Learning Tasks
   - Each Learning Task belongs to exactly one Course

2. Cascading Deletion
   - When a Course is deleted, associated Learning Tasks are removed
   - Prevent orphaned tasks

3. Query Optimization
   - Support efficient retrieval of tasks for a specific course
   - Implement reverse relationship lookups
   - Add prefetch and select_related optimizations

### Technical Requirements
- Use Django ORM relationship fields
- Implement custom manager methods
- Support lazy and eager loading of related objects
- Ensure referential integrity

## Validation Criteria
- [x] Foreign key constraints are respected
- [x] Query performance is optimized
- [x] Cascading deletion works as expected
- [x] Relationship methods are intuitive and performant

## Implementation Notes
- Use `ForeignKey` with `on_delete=models.CASCADE`
- Create custom QuerySet methods
- Implement related name for reverse lookups
- Consider using `prefetch_related` and `select_related`

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Course-Task relationship is correctly defined
2. Tasks can be efficiently queried by course
3. Deletion behavior is consistent
4. Performance is optimized for large datasets

## Estimated Effort
- Relationship Design: 2 story points
- Implementation: 3 story points
- Performance Optimization: 2 story points
- Total: 7 story points

## Potential Risks
- Performance with courses having many tasks
- Complexity of relationship queries
- Ensuring data consistency during migrations
