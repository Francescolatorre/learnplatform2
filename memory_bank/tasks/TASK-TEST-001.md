# Task: Develop Comprehensive Unit Tests for Learning Task Features

## Task Metadata
- **Task-ID:** TASK-TEST-001
- **Status:** TODO
- **Priority:** High
- **Dependencies:** 
  - TASK-API-001
  - TASK-VALIDATION-001

## Description
Create a robust test suite for Learning Task models, APIs, and associated features to ensure system reliability, data integrity, and performance.

## Requirements

### Test Coverage Areas
1. LearningTask Model Tests
   - Field validation
   - Custom method testing
   - Relationship integrity
   - Constraint enforcement
   - Edge case handling

2. API Endpoint Tests
   - Create task endpoint
   - Update task endpoint
   - Delete task endpoint
   - Retrieve task endpoints
   - Pagination and filtering
   - Error handling

3. Permission and Authorization Tests
   - Role-based access control
   - Unauthorized access scenarios
   - Permission boundary testing
   - User role transition tests

4. Status Transition Tests
   - Valid status change workflows
   - Invalid status change prevention
   - Audit trail verification
   - Transition rule enforcement

5. Integration Tests
   - Course-Task relationship
   - Submission and grading interactions
   - Performance under load
   - Cross-feature compatibility

### Technical Requirements
- Use pytest for test framework
- Implement factory-based test data generation
- Use Django test client for API testing
- Create comprehensive mock objects
- Support parameterized testing
- Implement coverage reporting

## Validation Criteria
- [x] Test coverage is above 90% for learning task features
- [x] Automated tests pass with no regressions
- [x] All critical paths and edge cases are tested
- [x] Performance tests validate system scalability

## Implementation Notes
- Use `pytest-django` for Django integration
- Implement `conftest.py` for shared fixtures
- Create test factories with `factory_boy`
- Use `pytest-cov` for coverage reporting
- Implement parametrized tests for multiple scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Comprehensive test suite is developed
2. All critical features are tested
3. Test coverage meets or exceeds 90%
4. Performance and load tests are included
5. Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline integration

## Estimated Effort
- Model Testing: 3 story points
- API Testing: 4 story points
- Permission Testing: 3 story points
- Integration Testing: 3 story points
- Total: 13 story points

## Potential Risks
- Complexity of permission testing
- Maintaining test suite with frequent changes
- Performance overhead of extensive testing
- Keeping tests updated with feature evolution
