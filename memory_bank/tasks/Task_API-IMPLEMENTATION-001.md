# Task Definition: API Implementation According to OpenAPI Specification

## Task ID
TASK-API-IMPLEMENTATION-001

## Status
TODO

## Type
Implementation

## Priority
High

## Description
Implement the API endpoints for the Learning Platform backend according to the provided OpenAPI specification. This task involves extending the existing models, creating serializers, implementing views/viewsets, and configuring URLs to match the API specification.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Implement authentication endpoints (register, login, logout, password reset, profile, token refresh)
2. Implement course management endpoints (list, create, retrieve, update, delete courses)
3. Implement task management endpoints (learning tasks, multiple choice quizzes, submissions)
4. Implement health check endpoint
5. Ensure all endpoints match the OpenAPI specification provided

### Technical Requirements
1. Use Django REST Framework with JWT authentication
2. Extend existing models to support all required fields
3. Create proper serializers for data validation and transformation
4. Implement views and viewsets for handling API endpoints
5. Configure URLs according to the API specification
6. Generate OpenAPI schema that matches the provided specification

### Acceptance Criteria
1. All API endpoints are implemented according to the OpenAPI specification
2. Authentication system works correctly with JWT tokens
3. Course management endpoints allow CRUD operations on courses
4. Task management endpoints support all required operations
5. API documentation is generated and matches the provided specification
6. All endpoints pass manual testing

## Dependencies
- Existing models in core/models.py
- Django project setup

## Resources
- [API Implementation Plan ADR](../ADRs/api_implementation_plan.md)
- OpenAPI specification provided by the user

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Model Extensions
1. Install required packages (djangorestframework, djangorestframework-simplejwt, drf-spectacular)
2. Update settings.py with REST Framework and JWT configurations
3. Extend existing models to support all required fields
4. Run migrations to update the database schema

### Phase 2: Authentication API
1. Implement User serializers (registration, login, profile, password reset)
2. Create authentication views (register, login, logout, password reset, profile)
3. Configure authentication URLs

### Phase 3: Course API
1. Implement Course serializer
2. Create CourseViewSet for handling course operations
3. Configure course URLs

### Phase 4: Task API
1. Implement LearningTask serializers
2. Create LearningTaskViewSet for handling task operations
3. Implement MultipleChoiceQuiz serializers and viewsets
4. Configure task URLs

### Phase 5: Testing and Documentation
1. Test all API endpoints manually
2. Generate OpenAPI schema
3. Create API documentation
4. Verify that the generated schema matches the provided specification

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Existing models may not fully support the required fields
  - **Mitigation**: Carefully extend models and use migrations to update the schema

- **Risk**: Authentication system may have security vulnerabilities
  - **Mitigation**: Follow best practices for JWT implementation and test thoroughly

- **Risk**: API endpoints may not match the OpenAPI specification exactly
  - **Mitigation**: Use drf-spectacular to generate the schema and compare with the provided specification

## Estimated Effort
