---

## 1. Description

The goal of this task is to standardize the structure, implementation, and documentation of all TypeScript-based service modules within the project. This will improve maintainability, scalability, onboarding, and code quality across the codebase.

---

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

- All TypeScript service modules must follow a unified folder and file naming convention.
- Each service must expose a consistent public API (method signatures, error handling, return types).
- Services must include comprehensive JSDoc/TSDoc comments for all public methods.
- Dependency injection or a standardized pattern for external dependencies must be used.
- All services must include unit tests with a minimum coverage threshold (e.g., 80%).
- All services must also provide tests until db level e.g. in src/tests/api-only.spec.ts
- Service modules must not contain business logic unrelated to their domain responsibility.
- All services must be compatible with the project's linting and formatting rules.
- All React hooks must comply with and use the standardized TypeScript service modules for all data access, business logic, and side effects. Hooks must not implement their own data fetching or business logic outside of these services.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

- Documentation for each service must be available and up-to-date.
- Services must be performant and avoid unnecessary resource consumption.
- The standardization process must not break existing integrations; migration guides must be provided.
- The standard must be reviewed and updated at least once per release cycle.

## Analysis: React Hooks Compliance (2025-04-14)

A codebase-wide search identified numerous custom React hooks (e.g., useDebounce, useApiResource, useTaskData, useCourseTasks, useCourses, useCourseProgress, useTaskCreation, and various store hooks). Some hooks are already implemented in the services layer or utilize service modules, but there is no explicit enforcement of standardized service usage across all hooks.

**Current State:**

- Hooks are distributed across utils/, services/, store/, and context/ directories.
- Some hooks (e.g., useApiResource, useTaskData, useCourseTasks) directly access APIs or implement business logic, sometimes duplicating logic found in service modules.
- Several hooks (e.g., useTaskCreation) have been refactored to use service modules, but this is not consistent project-wide.

**Required Actions for Compliance:**

- Audit all custom React hooks to ensure they delegate all data access, business logic, and side effects to the standardized TypeScript service modules.
- Refactor any hooks that implement their own data fetching or business logic to use the appropriate service modules instead.
- Update documentation and code review checklists to enforce this requirement for all new and existing hooks.
- Add automated linting or static analysis rules if feasible to detect non-compliant hooks.

**Next Steps:**

- Complete a full audit and refactor of all custom hooks for compliance.
- Update acceptance criteria and migration guides as needed.

---

## 3. User Stories

- **US-01:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript services to have a consistent structure so that I can quickly understand and modify any service module.
- **US-02:** As a new team member, I want clear documentation and examples for each service so that I can onboard efficiently.
- **US-03:** As a code reviewer, I want to ensure that all services adhere to the standard so that code quality and maintainability are preserved.
- **US-04:** As a product owner, I want the standardization to be non-disruptive to ongoing development so that project timelines are not negatively impacted.

---

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A documented standard for TypeScript service modules exists and is accessible to all developers.
- [ ] All new TypeScript services created after the standard is published follow the standard.
- [ ] At least one existing service is refactored to demonstrate the standard.
- [ ] Automated linting and code review checks are updated to enforce the standard.
- [ ] Migration documentation is available for updating legacy services.
- [ ] Unit test coverage for all services meets or exceeds the defined threshold.
- [ ] The standard and its adoption are reviewed and approved by Architect Mode.

### [2025-04-11 15:12] [IN_PROGRESS] [TYPESCRIPT-SERVICES-STANDARDIZATION-001]

- Refactored frontend/src/services/resources/courseService.ts to comply with the TypeScript Services Standardization Initiative:
  - Added comprehensive class-level TSDoc to CourseService for full documentation compliance.
  - Verified all public methods have TSDoc and consistent async API signatures.
  - Confirmed dependency usage and domain-focused logic are standard-compliant.
  - Noted pre-existing TypeScript typing issues with apiService; these are out of scope for this refactoring and must be addressed in a separate task.
- No changes made to business logic or API surface to preserve backward compatibility.
- All changes logged for traceability and compliance with governance requirements.

## Migration Log

### [2025-04-11 15:27] [IN_PROGRESS] [TYPESCRIPT-SERVICES-STANDARDIZATION-001]

- Created [Migration Guide: Updating Legacy TypeScript Services](../docs/typescript_service_migration.md) to provide a comprehensive, step-by-step process for updating legacy TypeScript services to the new standard.
- The guide covers structure, API, documentation, dependency management, testing, and compliance, and is referenced in both this task file and developer documentation for traceability and compliance with governance requirements.

### [2025-04-11 14:58] Migration from progress.md

All log entries related to the TypeScript Services Standardization Initiative (creation, orchestration, status updates, and audits) have been migrated from memory_bank/progress.md to this task file for aggregation and traceability. This action was performed to centralize all relevant logs and ensure compliance with governance requirements.
[2025-04-11 15:08 CEST] [TYPESCRIPT-SERVICES-STANDARDIZATION-001]: Verified that the TypeScript services standard is documented and accessible to all developers at memory_bank/drafts/typescript_services_standardization.md. Status of the standard is currently DRAFT; next step is Architect Mode review for validation.

### [2025-04-11 15:19] [IN_PROGRESS] [TYPESCRIPT-SERVICES-STANDARDIZATION-001]

- Updated `frontend/eslint.config.js` to enforce:
  - JSDoc/TSDoc for all public classes and methods in services (`@typescript-eslint/require-jsdoc`).
  - Explicit return types for exported functions (`@typescript-eslint/explicit-module-boundary-types`).
  - Async function enforcement for service methods (`@typescript-eslint/promise-function-async`).
  - Service file/folder naming convention (`filenames/match-regex`).
- Created `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` with a checklist for TypeScript service standardization (naming, API, docs, dependency pattern, test coverage, domain logic, documentation, lint/format compliance).
- Updated `frontend/README.md` with a new section summarizing the TypeScript Services Standardization Initiative, enforcement mechanisms, and references to the full standard and migration guide.
- All changes are traceable to this task and rationale is documented for compliance with governance requirements.
