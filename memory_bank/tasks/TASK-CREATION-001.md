# Task: Enable Instructors to Create Learning Tasks for a Course

## Task Metadata
- **Task-ID:** TASK-CREATION-001
- **Status:** TODO
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Dependencies:** COURSE-INSTRUCTOR-001

## Description
Enable instructors to create learning tasks for a specific course through a dedicated interface with proper authorization and validation.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Add task creation form in the instructor interface
   - Input fields:
     - Title (required)
     - Description (required)
     - Optional metadata
   - Associate tasks with a specific course
   - Implement role-based access control

2. Authorization Constraints
   - Only instructors with `can_manage_tasks` permission can create tasks
   - Validate user permissions before allowing task creation

### Technical Requirements
- Frontend: Create form component in React
- Backend: Implement task creation endpoint
- Database: Persist task data with proper course association

## Validation Criteria
- [x] Only authorized instructors can create tasks
- [x] Tasks are properly linked to courses
- [x] Task data is correctly persisted in the database
- [x] Form includes all required fields
- [x] Proper error handling for unauthorized or invalid task creation

## Implementation Notes
- Utilize existing course and user models
- Implement permission checks in both frontend and backend
- Use Django REST Framework for backend API
- Create TypeScript interfaces for task data

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Instructor can access task creation form
2. Form validates input before submission
3. Task is saved and associated with correct course
4. Unauthorized users are prevented from creating tasks

## Estimated Effort
- Frontend: 3 story points
- Backend: 5 story points
- Total: 8 story points

## Open Questions
- Specific metadata fields to be included
- Exact permission model for task management

## Potential Risks
- Ensuring consistent permission checks
- Handling edge cases in task creation process
