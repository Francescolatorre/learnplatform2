# Task Transition from QuizTask to LearningTask

## Objective
Remove all instances and references of the `QuizTask` model from the codebase and ensure that all functionalities are properly handled by the `Task` class with specific task types.

## Steps

### 1. Code Refactoring
- Search and replace all occurrences of `QuizTask` with `LearningTask` where the task type is relevant (e.g., `QUIZ`).
- Ensure that all functionalities previously handled by `QuizTask` are now managed by `LearningTask` with the appropriate settings.

### 2. Update Serializers
- Modify serializers that reference `QuizTask` to use `LearningTask` with the correct task type settings.

### 3. Update Views
- Adjust viewsets that operate on `QuizTask` to handle `LearningTask` with specific types.

### 4. Update Tests
- Ensure that all tests reflect the new model structure and do not use `QuizTask`.

### 5. Database and Migrations Review
- Review the database schema and migration files to ensure there are no remnants of `QuizTask`.
- Update migrations if necessary to reflect the changes in the model structure.

### 6. Documentation and Comments
- Update any comments or documentation within the codebase to accurately reflect the use of the `LearningTask` model instead of `QuizTask`.

### 7. Integration Testing
- Conduct thorough testing to ensure that the system behaves as expected without `QuizTask` and that the new task handling is functioning correctly.

## Validation Criteria
- No references to `QuizTask` exist in the codebase.
- All functionalities previously handled by `QuizTask` are seamlessly managed by `LearningTask`.
- All tests pass with the updated model structure.
- The system performs as expected in all scenarios previously covered by `QuizTask`.
