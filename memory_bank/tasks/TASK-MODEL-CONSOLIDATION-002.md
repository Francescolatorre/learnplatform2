# Task Definition: Consolidate and Standardize Data Models

## Task ID
TASK-MODEL-CONSOLIDATION-002

## Task Description
Implement the model update plan created in TASK-MODEL-UPDATE-PLAN-001 to consolidate and standardize data models across the learning platform.

## Requirements
1.  **Course Model Update**:
    *   Update `learningplatform/models.py.Course` to incorporate `duration` and `difficulty_level` from `courses/models.py.Course`.
    *   Ensure standardized foreign key relationships with explicit import for User model.
    *   Maintain existing fields: `title`, `description`, `instructor`, `status`, `visibility`, `learning_objectives`, `prerequisites`.
2.  **Task Model Consolidation**:
    *   Enhance `learningplatform/models.py.Task` to incorporate attributes from task models in `tasks/models.py`.
    *   Add fields: `difficulty_level`, `max_submissions`, `time_limit`, `is_randomized`.
    *   Expand `task_type` choices to include all necessary task types.
    *   Update related serializers and views to use the consolidated Task model.
3.  **Remove Redundant Models**:
    *   After successful migration, remove redundant models from other apps.
    *   Update imports across the codebase to use the consolidated models.
4.  **Migration Implementation**:
    *   Create migration files for model updates.
    *   Implement data migration scripts to transfer data from old models to consolidated ones.
5.  **Test Data Regeneration**:
    *   Update test data generation scripts to use the consolidated models.
    *   Regenerate test data to verify model functionality.

## Validation Criteria
*   All model updates must be implemented according to the plan in TASK-MODEL-UPDATE-PLAN-001.
*   Migrations must run successfully without data loss.
*   Existing functionality must be maintained.
*   Test data must be regenerated successfully.
*   Unit tests must pass with the consolidated models.

## Resources
*   TASK-MODEL-UPDATE-PLAN-001
*   ADR: Model Consolidation and Relationship Strategy
*   ADR: Model Consolidation Review
*   Existing model definitions in `courses/models.py`, `learningplatform/models.py`, and `tasks/models.py`

## Risks
*   Potential data loss during migration.
*   Breaking changes in existing code.
*   Regression in functionality.

## Mitigation Strategies
*   Create backups before running migrations.
*   Implement comprehensive tests to verify functionality.
*   Update all affected code paths to use the consolidated models.

## Communications
*   Communicate progress and any issues to the team.
*   Document all changes in the ADRs.
