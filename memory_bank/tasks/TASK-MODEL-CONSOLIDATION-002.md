# Model Consolidation Implementation Tasks

## Objective
Consolidate and standardize data models across the learning platform

## Tasks

### 1. Model Update Preparation
- [ ] Review current model implementations in all apps
- [ ] Identify redundant and conflicting model definitions
- [ ] Determine target model structure base

### 2. Learningplatform Models Update
- [ ] Enhance Course model with additional attributes
  - Add duration field
  - Add difficulty level field
- [ ] Verify User model completeness
- [ ] Refine Task model to support multiple task types

### 3. Model Cleanup
- [ ] Remove redundant Course models from:
  - courses/models.py
  - learning/models.py
- [ ] Consolidate task-related models
  - Remove complex inheritance in tasks/models.py
  - Migrate task type logic to learningplatform Task model

### 4. Serializer and View Updates
- [ ] Update course serializers to match new model
- [ ] Modify task serializers for consolidated model
- [ ] Adjust views to work with updated models

### 5. Test Data Regeneration
- [ ] Update create_test_data.py script
- [ ] Ensure test data reflects new model structure
- [ ] Verify test data generation works correctly

### 6. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Verify model relationships
- [ ] Check serializer and view functionality
- [ ] Perform integration testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All model definitions are consolidated
- [ ] No duplicate model implementations
- [ ] Test data can be generated successfully
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] No breaking changes in core functionality

## Risks
- Potential breaking changes in existing code
- Need for comprehensive testing
- Ensuring all app functionalities remain intact

## Notes
- No database migration required
- Focus on code structure and test data consistency
