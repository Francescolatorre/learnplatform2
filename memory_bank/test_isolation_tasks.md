## Success Criteria

### Unit Tests
- [ ] No database access
- [ ] < 100ms execution time
- [ ] Clear mocking patterns
- [ ] Good coverage

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Proper transaction isolation
- [ ] Clear component boundaries
- [ ] Reliable execution
- [ ] Good error handling

### DB Tests
- [ ] Proper constraint testing
- [ ] Clear data setup
- [ ] Transaction management
- [ ] Migration testing

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Accurate timing measurements
- [ ] Realistic data volumes
- [ ] Clear baselines
- [ ] Reliable results

## Validation Steps

For each migrated test file:
1. Run with specific marker
2. Verify correct settings loaded
3. Check execution time
4. Validate isolation
5. Review error handling
6. Check CI pipeline execution

## Rollback Plan

1. Keep backup of original test files
2. Document all changes
3. Test both configurations
4. Update gradually
5. Monitor test reliability

## Dependencies

1. PostgreSQL setup for performance tests
2. Updated pytest configuration
3. CI/CD pipeline access
4. Test infrastructure updates

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risks
1. Breaking existing tests
2. Performance regression
3. CI pipeline disruption
4. Test reliability issues

### Mitigations
1. Gradual rollout
2. Comprehensive testing
3. Clear documentation
4. Monitoring and alerts
