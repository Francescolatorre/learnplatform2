# Domain Restructuring Implementation Summary

## Motivation
Cross-app imports and unclear domain boundaries were causing architectural complexity in the learning platform. This restructuring aims to:
- Reduce coupling between apps
- Create clearer separation of concerns
- Improve maintainability and testability

## Key Changes

### 1. Tasks App
- Created a new `tasks` app with base and specialized task models
- Introduced abstract `BaseTask` with common task attributes
- Specialized task types:
  - `LearningTask`
  - `AssessmentTask`
  - `QuizTask`

### 2. Learning App
- Migrated `Course` model from `courses` app
- Updated to use new `LearningTask` model
- Added methods for task management

### 3. Assessment App
- Restructured to use new task models
- Introduced `Quiz` model to replace course-based progress tracking
- Updated `Submission` and `UserProgress` models

### 4. Settings Configuration
- Added new apps to `INSTALLED_APPS`
- Commented out deprecated apps

## Benefits
- Reduced cross-app dependencies
- More flexible task and assessment modeling
- Clearer domain boundaries
- Easier to extend and maintain

## Next Steps
1. Create data migration scripts
2. Update existing views and serializers
3. Refactor tests
4. Gradually remove deprecated apps

## Potential Challenges
- Existing data migration
- Updating references in other parts of the system
- Ensuring backward compatibility during transition
