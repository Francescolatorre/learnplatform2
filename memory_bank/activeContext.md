Task-ID: TEST-005
Description: Implement model layer testing structure
Requirements:
  - Create model test organization
  - Set up model validation tests
  - Implement model relationship tests
  - Create model factory patterns
Validation:
  - Model test structure follows established patterns

## Implementation Progress

### Latest Changes
- Created AssessmentRepository implementation
- Set up repository test structure with proper database fixtures
- Implemented CRUD tests for AssessmentRepository
- Added test fixtures for database operations
- Created example tests for AssessmentRepository
- Fixed app label conflicts in Django configuration
- Set up proper database migrations for test dependencies
- Documented repository testing patterns

### Technical Decisions
- Using pytest as the primary testing framework
- Factory pattern for test data generation
- Focus on CRUD operation testing for repositories
- Separate test configurations for different test types
- Transaction-based test isolation for database tests
- In-memory SQLite database for testing

### Blocking Issues
None

### Next Steps
1. Begin model layer testing implementation
2. Set up model validation test structure
3. Create model relationship test patterns
4. Document model testing strategy

## Notes
- Focus on CRUD testing for repositories
- Maintain consistent test patterns established in AssessmentService tests
- Follow documentation standards in README files
- Leverage existing test utilities and fixtures
- Ensure proper test isolation using pytest fixtures
- Model tests should focus on validation and relationships
