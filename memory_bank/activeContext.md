## Implementation Notes

1. Each task builds on patterns established in repository testing
2. Focus on maintaining high test coverage
3. Apply learnings from repository layer testing
4. Keep documentation updated with new patterns
5. Review and update learnings.md with new insights

## Current Status
- Repository layer testing complete
- All tests passing
- Documentation updated
- Learnings captured
- Next tasks prepared

## Priorities
1. Service layer testing (TEST-007)
2. API integration testing (TEST-008)
3. Performance testing (TEST-009)
4. End-to-end testing (TEST-010)

## Dependencies
