# Course Management System Implementation Tasks

Task-ID: COURSE-VERSION-001
Description: Implement course versioning system for tracking and managing course revisions

Requirements:
  - [ ] Create VersionControl service in backend/core/services/version_control_service.py:
    * Version increment logic
    * Version comparison utilities
    * Version history tracking
    * Rollback capabilities with data integrity checks

  - [ ] Enhance Course model version handling:
    * Add version metadata fields (created_from, version_notes)
    * Implement version comparison methods
    * Add version history relationship
    * Create version rollback methods

  - [ ] Implement CourseVersion model in backend/learning/models.py:
    * Fields: version_number, created_at, created_by, notes
    * Snapshot of course content at version point
    * Relationship to parent course
    * Version metadata and change tracking

  - [ ] Update CourseSerializer:
    * Add version-related fields
    * Include version history in responses
    * Support version comparison
    * Handle rollback operations

Validation:
  - [ ] Version numbers increment correctly
  - [ ] Version history maintains accurate snapshots
  - [ ] Changes between versions are properly tracked
  - [ ] Rollback operations preserve data integrity
  - [ ] Version metadata is complete and accurate
  - [ ] Invalid operations are prevented
  - [ ] Version comparison works correctly
