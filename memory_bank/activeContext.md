# Remaining tasks from previous context
Task-ID: COURSE-VERSION-001
Description: Implement course versioning system for tracking and managing course revisions

Requirements:
  - [x] Create VersionControl service in backend/core/services/version_control_service.py:
    * Version increment logic
    * Version comparison utilities
    * Version history tracking
    * Rollback capabilities with data integrity checks
  - [x] Enhance Course model version handling:
    * Add version metadata fields (created_from, version_notes)
    * Implement version comparison methods
    * Add version history relationship
    * Create version rollback methods
  - [x] Implement CourseVersion model in backend/learning/models.py:
    * Fields: version_number, created_at, created_by, notes
    * Snapshot of course content at version point
    * Relationship to parent course
    * Version metadata and change tracking
  - [x] Update CourseSerializer:
    * Add version-related fields
    * Include version history in responses
    * Support version comparison
    * Handle rollback operations

Validation:
  - [x] Version numbers increment correctly
  - [x] Version history maintains accurate snapshots
  - [x] Changes between versions are properly tracked
  - [x] Rollback operations preserve data integrity
  - [x] Version metadata is complete and accurate
  - [x] Invalid operations are prevented
  - [x] Version comparison works correctly

Status: IN_PROGRESS
Dependencies: [COURSE-MODEL-001]

Next Steps:
1. Create version_control_service.py
2. Implement CourseVersion model
3. Update Course model with version features
4. Enhance serializer for version support
5. Add comprehensive tests for versioning
