- [x] Basic Learning Tasks
- [x] Assessment Framework

### Task Types
- [x] Text Submission Task Type
- [x] File Upload Task Type
- [x] Multiple Choice Quiz Task Type
- [ ] Project Task Type
- [ ] Discussion Task Type

## Multiple Choice Quiz Task Type Implementation
- Status: COMPLETED (TASK-TYPE-003)
- Date: 2/28/2025
- Key Features Implemented:
  * Configurable questions and options
  * Automatic grading and feedback
  * Randomization of questions and options
  * Timed assessments with progress tracking
  * Secure delivery and prevention of cheating

## Backend Recreation Status
- Status: IN_PROGRESS (TASK-API-IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETION)
- Date: 3/4/2025
- Key Components:
  * Database models defined and migrations applied
  * API implementation planned according to OpenAPI specification
  * Authentication system design completed

## Upcoming Tasks
- Complete API implementation according to OpenAPI specification (TASK-API-IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETION)
- Implement student-focused features:
  * Personalized Learning Path (TASK-PERSONALIZED-LEARNING)
  * Adaptive Assessment (TASK-ADAPTIVE-ASSESSMENT)
  * AI-Powered Submission Evaluation (TASK-AI-POWERED-SUBMISSION)
  * Course Exploration and Enrollment (TASK-COURSE-EXPLORATION)
- Complete model consolidation (TASK-MODEL-CONSOLIDATION-002)
- Implement Task Progress Tracking UI (TASK-UI-005)

## Technical Debt
- Task naming inconsistencies need to be resolved
- Some task files need to be archived or consolidated
- Status tracking across different files needs to be synchronized

## Performance Considerations
- Monitor quiz submission performance
- Optimize database queries for quiz-related operations
- Ensure API endpoint performance meets requirements
- Implement performance and security enhancements (TASK-PERFORMANCE_SECURITY_ENHANCEMENTS)

## Next Sprint Focus
- Complete API implementation according to OpenAPI specification
- Begin implementation of student-focused features
- Consolidate and standardize task structure
- Update documentation to reflect current project status
